# An AI Quick Search Engine and a ReAct Search Agent
This project aims to create two search mechanisms. 
An AI model review and summary the search results to answer user's query. This approach saves user a lot of time skimming through results to find the answer. In addition, the AI response to user's query bases on real data and user can go to the source of the data to verify when necessary.
A ReAct agent to research a topic/query provided by user. The ReAct agent's advantage is that it not only returns the answer but also generates some new ideas along the way which can help the user brainstorming a task/project. The search agent's answers base on real data and user can go to the source of the data to verify when necessary.
